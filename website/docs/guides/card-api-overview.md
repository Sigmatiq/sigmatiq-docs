# Card API - Beginner's Guide

## What Are Trading Cards?

Trading Cards are pre-packaged, easy-to-understand snapshots of market data designed specifically for beginner traders. Instead of overwhelming you with raw numbers and complex charts, Cards present information in three simple levels:

- **Beginner Mode**: Plain English, simple explanations, what it means for your trading
- **Intermediate Mode**: More detail, multiple metrics, trading implications
- **Advanced Mode**: Full technical data for experienced traders

Think of Cards as your trading dashboard - each Card answers a specific question you need to know before making a trade.

## Why Use Cards Instead of Raw Data?

### The Problem with Raw Market Data
When you're starting out, looking at market data can be overwhelming:
- Too many numbers without context
- No guidance on what matters
- Hard to know what's normal vs unusual
- Unclear what action to take

### How Cards Solve This
Each Card:
1. **Focuses on one thing** - Market health, stock momentum, options activity, etc.
2. **Explains in plain language** - No jargon unless explained
3. **Tells you what it means** - Not just numbers, but interpretation
4. **Suggests what to do** - Actionable guidance for your trading
5. **Warns about risks** - Highlights dangers for beginners

## How to Use Cards: The Trading Workflow

### 1. Morning Routine (Before Trading)

**Check Market Environment (5 minutes):**
```
1. Market Summary  Is today a good day to trade?
2. Market Breadth  Are most stocks healthy?
3. Sector Rotation  Which sectors are strong?
4. Economic Calendar  Any major events today?
```

**Decision Point**:
- Market Summary > 65 + Strong breadth = Good day for longs
- Market Summary < 40 + Weak breadth = Defensive day, avoid or short
- Economic Calendar has major event = Wait until after

### 2. Stock Selection (When You Have an Idea)

**Quick Check (2 minutes):**
```
1. Ticker Performance  What's the basic picture?
2. Ticker Trend  Is it trending the right direction?
3. 52-Week Range  Near highs or lows?
4. Ticker Liquidity  Can I trade this easily?
```

**Decision Point**:
- Uptrend + good volume + not overbought = Potential buy
- Downtrend or low liquidity = Skip it

### 3. Confirm Your Idea (5 minutes)

**Detailed Analysis:**
```
1. Ticker Momentum  Confirm buying/selling pressure
2. Relative Strength  Is it outperforming?
3. Ticker Volatility  How much risk?
4. Economic Calendar  Earnings soon?
```

**For advanced traders:**
```
5. Short Interest  Squeeze risk?
6. Insider Transactions  What do insiders know?
7. Analyst Ratings  Wall Street view?
```

### 4. Size Your Position (Before Placing Order)

**Risk Management (2 minutes):**
```
1. Position Sizer  Calculate shares based on risk
2. Risk Calculator  Verify your risk/reward ratio
3. Ticker Volatility  Adjust for volatility
```

**Rules**:
- Never risk more than 1-2% of account per trade
- Minimum 2:1 reward/risk ratio (better = 3:1)
- If you can't get good R:R, skip the trade

### 5. Options Traders (If Applicable)

**Options Analysis:**
```
1. Unusual Options  Is IV high or low?
2. Options Chain Summary  PCR and pricing
3. IV Skew  Are options expensive?
```

## Example: Trading AAPL Using Cards

**Scenario**: You're thinking about buying Apple (AAPL). Here's how to use Cards:

### Step 1: Check Market
```
Card: Market Summary
Result: Score 72 (Healthy) - "Favorable conditions for long positions"
Card: Sector Rotation
Result: Technology (XLK) is top sector, +1.2% today
 Market supports tech longs
```

### Step 2: Check AAPL Basics
```
Card: Ticker Performance (AAPL)
Result: Up 0.8%, high volume, RSI 58 (neutral), above MA50
Card: Ticker Trend (AAPL)
Result: "Strong Uptrend" - Price above all moving averages
Card: 52-Week Range (AAPL)
Result: 85% of range, 5% from 52-week high
 Strong stock in uptrend
```

### Step 3: Confirm Entry
```
Card: Ticker Momentum (AAPL)
Result: "Moderate Bullish" - Multiple indicators confirm
Card: Ticker Liquidity (AAPL)
Result: "Excellent" - $8.5B daily volume
Card: Earnings Calendar (AAPL)
Result: Earnings in 23 days (safe window)
 Good momentum, no immediate event risk
```

### Step 4: Size Position
```
Your account: $25,000
Risk tolerance: 1% = $250 max loss
Entry price: $185
Stop loss: $182 (below recent support)
Risk per share: $3

Card: Position Sizer
Calculation: $250  $3 = 83 shares
Position cost: 83  $185 = $15,355 (61% of account)

Card: Risk Calculator
Entry: $185, Target: $194, Stop: $182
Risk: $3, Reward: $9
R:R = 3:1  (Excellent)
Breakeven win rate: 25%
 Great risk/reward
```

### Step 5: Execute
- Buy 83 shares AAPL at $185
- Set stop at $182
- Target $194 (but let it run if momentum continues)
- Max loss: $250 (1% of account)

## Common Beginner Mistakes (And How Cards Help)

### Mistake 1: Trading Against the Market
**Problem**: You buy a stock when the overall market is weak
**Card Solution**: Always check Market Summary and Market Breadth first
**Rule**: Don't fight the market. If breadth is weak, be defensive

### Mistake 2: Buying Downtrends
**Problem**: You buy a stock because "it's cheap" but it's falling
**Card Solution**: Check Ticker Trend - only buy established uptrends
**Rule**: Trend is your friend. Never try to catch falling knives

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Liquidity
**Problem**: You trade a low-volume stock and can't exit
**Card Solution**: Check Ticker Liquidity before every trade
**Rule**: Only trade stocks with "High" or "Moderate" liquidity

### Mistake 4: Risking Too Much
**Problem**: You risk 10% of your account and blow up after 3 losses
**Card Solution**: Use Position Sizer for every trade
**Rule**: Never risk more than 1-2% per trade

### Mistake 5: Bad Risk/Reward
**Problem**: You risk $5 to make $3 (0.6:1 R:R)
**Card Solution**: Use Risk Calculator before entering
**Rule**: Minimum 2:1 R:R. If you can't get it, skip the trade

### Mistake 6: Trading Into Earnings
**Problem**: You buy a stock the day before earnings and get crushed
**Card Solution**: Check Economic Calendar and Earnings Calendar
**Rule**: Avoid trading 1-3 days before major events (unless that's your strategy)

### Mistake 7: Overpaying for Options
**Problem**: You buy options when IV is 95th percentile (extremely expensive)
**Card Solution**: Check Unusual Options and IV Skew
**Rule**: Buy options when IV is low (&lt;30th percentile), sell when high (&gt;70th percentile)

## How to Read Card Data

### Understanding Percentiles
Many cards use percentiles (0-100%):
- **90th percentile** = Better than 90% of all stocks
- **50th percentile** = Average (median)
- **10th percentile** = Worse than 90% of all stocks

**Examples**:
- Relative Strength 95th percentile = Stock outperforms 95% of market (Elite)
- Liquidity 80th percentile = More liquid than 80% of stocks (Excellent)
- IV Percentile 10th percentile = Options cheaper than usual (Good time to buy)

### Understanding Ratios
**Put/Call Ratio (PCR)**:
- PCR > 1.5 = Very bearish (lots of puts)
- PCR 1.0-1.5 = Bearish (more puts than calls)
- PCR 0.7-1.0 = Neutral
- PCR < 0.7 = Bullish (more calls)

**Risk/Reward Ratio (R:R)**:
- 3:1 or better = Excellent trade
- 2:1 = Good minimum standard
- 1:1 = Break-even needed, acceptable only if high win rate
- < 1:1 = Bad trade, avoid

**Advance/Decline Ratio (AD)**:
- AD > 2.0 = Very strong (twice as many advancing)
- AD 1.0-2.0 = Healthy (more advancing than declining)
- AD 0.5-1.0 = Weak (more declining than advancing)
- AD < 0.5 = Very weak (twice as many declining)

### Understanding Moving Averages
**What They Are**: Average price over X days
- **MA20** = 20-day average (short-term trend)
- **MA50** = 50-day average (intermediate trend)
- **MA200** = 200-day average (long-term trend)

**How to Use Them**:
- Price > MA = Uptrend at that timeframe
- Price < MA = Downtrend at that timeframe
- MA20 > MA50 > MA200 = Perfect bullish alignment
- MA crossing = Trend change signal

### Understanding Oscillators
**RSI (Relative Strength Index)**:
- RSI > 70 = Overbought (potential pullback)
- RSI 40-60 = Neutral
- RSI < 30 = Oversold (potential bounce)

**MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**:
- MACD > Signal = Bullish momentum
- MACD < Signal = Bearish momentum
- MACD crossing signal = Change in momentum

**Stochastic**:
- Stochastic > 80 = Overbought
- Stochastic 20-80 = Neutral range
- Stochastic < 20 = Oversold
