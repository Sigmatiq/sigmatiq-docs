# Market Analysis (Overview)

This guide shows beginners how to quickly assess overall market conditions before trading.

## Check These First

- Market Breadth — Are most stocks healthy or weak?
- Index Leadership — Who is leading (QQQ, SPY, IWM)?
- Sector Rotation — Which sectors are strong/weak?
- Volatility — Is risk rising or falling?

## Recommended Cards

1. Market Breadth — overall market health
2. Index Heatmap — leadership and relative performance
3. Sector Rotation — where strength is rotating

## Tips for Beginners

- When breadth is weak and volatility rising, size down or sit out.
- Trade in the direction of leadership (don’t fight strong trends).
- Avoid adding risk ahead of major events (earnings, CPI, FOMC).
