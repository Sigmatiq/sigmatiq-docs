# Market Overview Cards - Detailed Guide

## Why Check Market Cards First?

**The Golden Rule of Trading**: Don't fight the market.

Before you look at any individual stock, you need to know:
- Is the overall market strong or weak?
- Are most stocks going up or down?
- Is the market trending or choppy?
- Which sectors/indices are leading?

**Why this matters**: Even great stocks struggle in weak markets. Even mediocre stocks can rise in strong markets. The market environment determines your edge.
