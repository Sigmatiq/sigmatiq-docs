# Card API - Proposed Future Enhancements

This document outlines improvements identified through comprehensive code review of all 34 card handlers. Enhancements are organized by priority and focus on making cards more actionable, robust, and beginner-friendly.

---

## Priority 1: Critical Issues & Fixes

### 1.1 Implement Watchlist Stats Handler
**Status**: Currently template-only
**Impact**: High (blocking feature)
**File**: `watchlist_stats.py`

**Issue**:
The watchlist_stats handler returns empty template data. Requires user authentication and watchlist management system.

**Proposed Solution**:
1. Implement user watchlist storage (database table `cd.user_watchlists`)
2. Add watchlist CRUD API endpoints
3. Implement aggregation queries across user's watchlist symbols
4. Calculate sector distribution, risk distribution, momentum analysis

**User Benefit**:
Daily overview of tracked stocks with aggregate metrics, sector exposure, and top movers.

---

### 1.2 Fix Column Naming Inconsistencies
**Impact**: Medium (potential runtime errors)
**Files**: `technical_breadth.py`, possibly others

**Issue**:
Query assumes columns like `pct_above_ma20` but schema likely has `above_ma20_pct` (noun_adjective vs adjective_noun).

**Code Example**:
```python
# Current (may fail):
SELECT pct_above_ma20, pct_above_ma50, pct_above_ma200
FROM sb.market_breadth_daily

# Should be:
SELECT above_ma20_pct, above_ma50_pct, above_ma200_pct
FROM sb.market_breadth_daily
```

**Proposed Solution**:
1. Audit all SQL queries against actual schema
2. Standardize column naming convention across all tables
3. Add schema validation tests
4. Document expected schema in each handler

**User Benefit**:
Prevents runtime errors, ensures data reliability.

---

### 1.3 Add Emoji-Free Fallback Labels
**Impact**: Medium (rendering issues)
**Files**: All handlers using emojis

**Issue**:
Heavy emoji usage may not render correctly in all clients (API consumers, terminals, older browsers).

**Current**:
```python
return {
    "trend": "Strong Uptrend "
}
```

**Proposed Solution**:
```python
return {
    "trend": "Strong Uptrend ",
    "trend_clean": "Strong Uptrend",  # Emoji-free fallback
    "trend_emoji": "",            # Separate emoji field
    "trend_code": "STRONG_UP"         # Machine-readable code
}
```

**User Benefit**:
Consistent experience across all platforms and clients.

---

### 1.4 Validate Missing Schema Fields
**Impact**: High (blocking deployments)
**Files**: `ticker_news.py`, `economic_calendar.py`

**Issue**:
Some handlers reference tables that may not exist in schema:
- `ticker_news.py`  `sb.news_feed` (verify existence)
- `economic_calendar.py`  `sb.economic_calendar` (verify structure)

**Proposed Solution**:
1. Schema audit - verify all referenced tables exist
2. Create missing tables with proper structure
3. Add integration tests that verify schema dependencies
4. Document schema requirements in README

**User Benefit**:
Cards work reliably without missing data errors.

---

### 1.5 Fix Market Summary Volatility Component
**Impact**: Low (functional but incomplete)
**File**: `market_summary.py`

**Issue**:
Volatility score hardcoded to 60.0 (placeholder). TODO comment says "Replace with VIX when available".

**Current Code**:
```python
# TODO: Replace with VIX when available
volatility_score = 60.0  # Placeholder
```

**Proposed Solution**:
```python
# Option 1: Use VIX data
vix_query = """
    SELECT close_price
    FROM sb.equity_bars_daily
    WHERE symbol = 'VIX' AND trading_date = $1
"""
vix = await self.pool.fetchval(vix_query, trading_date)
volatility_score = self._calculate_vix_score(vix)

# Option 2: Calculate historical volatility from SPY
spy_volatility = self._calculate_historical_volatility(spy_returns_20d)
volatility_score = self._normalize_volatility_score(spy_volatility)
```

**Scoring Logic**:
```python
def _calculate_vix_score(self, vix: float) -> float:
    """
    VIX score (inverted - low vol = high score):
    VIX < 12 = 90 (very low vol, favorable)
    VIX 12-15 = 75 (low vol)
    VIX 15-20 = 60 (normal)
    VIX 20-30 = 40 (elevated)
    VIX > 30 = 20 (high vol, unfavorable)
    """
    if vix < 12:
        return 90.0
    elif vix < 15:
        return 75.0
    elif vix < 20:
        return 60.0
    elif vix < 30:
        return 40.0
    else:
        return 20.0
```

**User Benefit**:
More accurate market health score incorporating actual volatility conditions.

---

## Priority 2: Action Blocks (Insight  Trade Plan)

### 2.1 Add Action Blocks to Card Responses
**Impact**: High (transforms cards from data  actionable guidance)
**Files**: All major ticker cards

**Concept**:
Convert data insights into structured trade plans with entry, stop, target, and risk parameters.

**Schema Addition**:
```python
"action_block": {
    "entry_context": "Pullback to MA20 support",
    "entry_trigger": "$182-$184 (MA20 zone)",
    "invalidation": "$178 (below MA50)",
    "stop_distance_pct": 3.0,
    "stop_distance_atr": 1.0,
    "risk_unit": "1 ATR",
    "position_sizing_hint": "With 1% risk, entry $183, stop $178  0.2% account per $1 stop",
    "targets": {
        "near": {"price": 188, "description": "Prior swing high"},
        "stretch": {"price": 194, "description": "52w high resistance"},
        "rr_ratio": 2.5  # (188-183)/(183-178)
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 75,  # 0-100
        "factors": [
            " Uptrend confirmed (price > all MAs)",
            " Strong momentum (RSI 58, MACD bullish)",
            " Healthy breadth (68% above MA50)",
            " Moderate liquidity (check spreads)"
        ]
    },
    "post_entry_checks": [
        "10-30 min: Volume pace  1.2 average",
        "End of day: Close above entry",
        "Day 2: No violation of MA20"
    ],
    "warnings": [
        "Earnings in 12 days - plan exit before",
        "Tech sector showing weakness - reduce size 25%"
    ]
}
```

**Confidence Score Calculation**:
```python
def _calculate_confidence_score(
    trend_strength: float,    # 0-100 from MA alignment
    momentum: float,           # 0-100 from oscillators
    breadth: float,            # 0-100 market breadth
    liquidity: float,          # 0-100 liquidity percentile
    volume_confirmation: bool  # High volume on move
) -> int:
    """
    Weighted confidence score:
    - Trend (30%): Is direction clear?
    - Momentum (25%): Buying/selling pressure?
    - Breadth (20%): Market supportive?
    - Liquidity (15%): Can we execute?
    - Volume (10%): Move confirmed?
    """
    score = (
        trend_strength * 0.30 +
        momentum * 0.25 +
        breadth * 0.20 +
        liquidity * 0.15 +
        (100 if volume_confirmation else 50) * 0.10
    )
    return min(100, max(0, int(score)))
```

**Phase 1 Implementation** (4 cards):
1. `market_breadth` - Market environment action block
2. `index_heatmap` - Which index to focus trading
3. `ticker_performance` - Individual stock trade plan
4. `ticker_momentum` - Momentum-based entry timing

**Phase 2 Implementation** (remaining cards):
- `ticker_trend`, `ticker_breakout`, `ticker_reversal`
- `unusual_options` (options-specific action blocks)

**User Benefit**:
Transforms "here's data" into "here's exactly what to do" - dramatically reduces decision paralysis for beginners.

---

### 2.2 Multi-Timeframe Alignment Flags
**Impact**: Medium (improves trade quality)
**Files**: All ticker cards

**Concept**:
Show daily AND weekly trend alignment to prevent counter-trend disasters.

**Addition to Response**:
```python
"timeframe_alignment": {
    "daily_trend": "UPTREND",
    "weekly_trend": "UPTREND",
    "alignment": "BULLISH",  # Both aligned up
    "interpretation": "Daily and weekly both bullish - high-probability long setups",
    "flag_emoji": "",
    "warning": null
}
```

**Alignment Types**:
- **BULLISH** (): Daily UP + Weekly UP  High confidence longs
- **BEARISH** (): Daily DOWN + Weekly DOWN  High confidence shorts (or avoid)
- **COUNTER_TREND** (): Daily UP + Weekly DOWN  Risky, reduce size
- **EARLY_REVERSAL** (): Daily DOWN + Weekly UP  Potential pullback in uptrend

**User Benefit**:
Prevents novice mistake of buying daily uptrends that are counter to weekly downtrends.

---

### 2.3 Tradability Metrics & Liquidity Warnings
**Impact**: Medium (prevents bad executions)
**Files**: All ticker cards

**Additions**:
```python
"tradability": {
    "dollar_volume_median_20d": 45_000_000,  # $45M median
    "spread_tier": "TIGHT",  # TIGHT / MODERATE / WIDE / VERY_WIDE
    "spread_estimate_bps": 5,  # 5 basis points (0.05%)
    "execution_quality": "EXCELLENT",  # EXCELLENT / GOOD / FAIR / POOR
    "warnings": []  # Empty if good
}
```

**Spread Tiers**:
- **TIGHT** (&lt;10 bps): Excellent execution, any size
- **MODERATE** (10-25 bps): Good for most traders
- **WIDE** (25-50 bps): Use limit orders only
- **VERY_WIDE** (&gt;50 bps): Avoid or very small size

**Warning Examples**:
```python
if dollar_volume < 5_000_000:
    warnings.append(" Low liquidity - use limit orders only, small positions")
if spread_bps > 25:
    warnings.append(" Wide spreads - expect slippage, use limit orders")
```

**User Benefit**:
Prevents beginners from trading illiquid stocks with terrible execution.

---

## Priority 3: Educational Enhancements

### 3.1 Expand Educational Content
**Impact**: High (core mission of beginner-first)
**Files**: All handlers

**Current State**:
Educational tips vary in quality - some excellent (position_sizer, risk_calculator), others minimal.

**Proposed Enhancements**:

**Add "How It Helps" Section**:
```python
"education": {
    "how_it_helps": "Market breadth prevents you from fighting the market. When only 30% of stocks are in uptrends, even great stock picks struggle. This card tells you when conditions favor your trading.",
    "what_to_avoid": [
        " Don't buy stocks when breadth &lt;40% (weak market)",
        " Don't ignore this card - it's more important than any single stock analysis"
    ],
    "visual_analogy": "Like checking if most runners in a race are moving forward or falling behind. If 70% are behind pace, the track conditions are bad - even fast runners struggle.",
    "historical_context": "In 2022 bear market, breadth stayed below 35% for months. Traders who ignored this lost money even on 'good' stocks."
}
```

**Add Pre-Trade Checklist**:
```python
"pre_trade_checklist": [
    {"item": "Trend alignment", "check": "Daily and weekly both up?", "status": ""},
    {"item": "RSI zone", "check": "Not overbought (RSI &lt;70)?", "status": ""},
    {"item": "Breadth", "check": "Market not weak (&lt;40%)?", "status": ""},
    {"item": "Earnings proximity", "check": "No earnings in 3 days?", "status": ""},
    {"item": "Liquidity", "check": "High or moderate liquidity?", "status": ""},
    {"overall": "CAUTION", "reason": "Market breadth weak - reduce position size 50%"}
]
```

**User Benefit**:
Deeper understanding of WHY each metric matters and HOW to use it practically.

---

### 3.2 Add Visual Analogies for Complex Concepts
**Impact**: Medium (improves comprehension)
**Files**: All cards with technical concepts

**Examples**:

**Correlation** (ticker_correlation.py):
```python
"visual_analogy": "Correlation is like measuring how two runners move together. 0.9 correlation = they're attached by a rope, moving in lockstep. 0.1 correlation = they're independent, one can sprint while other walks. -0.5 = when one speeds up, other slows down."
```

**Options IV** (unusual_options.py):
```python
"visual_analogy": "IV is like insurance premiums after a hurricane warning. High IV (expensive options) = market expects big moves, like hurricane coming. Low IV (cheap options) = market expects calm, like sunny forecast. Never buy insurance (options) right before the storm (earnings)."
```

**Moving Averages** (ticker_trend.py):
```python
"visual_analogy": "Moving averages are like pace markers in a race. MA20 = last 20 days pace, MA50 = last 50 days. Price above MA50 = you're ahead of your 50-day average pace (uptrend). Price below = you're falling behind (downtrend)."
```

**User Benefit**:
Makes abstract concepts concrete and memorable for visual learners.

---

### 3.3 Add Historical Success Rates
**Impact**: Medium (builds confidence in signals)
**Files**: Breakout, reversal, momentum cards

**Proposed Addition**:
```python
"historical_performance": {
    "signal": "High-quality breakout (volume &gt;1.5, RS &gt;75%)",
    "win_rate_1week": "68%",  # Based on backtest
    "avg_gain_winners": "+8.2%",
    "avg_loss_losers": "-3.1%",
    "expectancy": "+3.8%",  # (0.68  8.2%) + (0.32  -3.1%)
    "sample_size": 1247,  # Number of historical occurrences
    "context": "From 2020-2024 backtest on S&P 500 stocks",
    "caveat": "Past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Use proper risk management."
}
```

**Example Usage in Breakout Card**:
```python
if quality_score > 80:
    education["historical_context"] = (
        "High-quality breakouts (score &gt;80) have historically continued "
        "higher 68% of the time over the next 1-2 weeks (2020-2024 data). "
        "However, 32% still fail - always use stops."
    )
```

**User Benefit**:
Data-driven confidence in signals while maintaining realistic expectations.

---

## Priority 4: Options & Events Awareness

### 4.1 Add Earnings Proximity Warnings
**Impact**: High (prevents event risk disasters)
**Files**: All ticker cards

**Proposed Addition**:
```python
"event_risk": {
    "earnings_days_away": 5,
    "earnings_date": "2025-02-01",
    "expected_move_pct": 6.5,  # From options IV
    "warning_level": "HIGH",  # HIGH / MODERATE / LOW / NONE
    "trading_implications": [
        " Earnings in 5 days - high risk period",
        "Expected move: 6.5% (from options pricing)",
        "Recommendation: Exit 1-2 days before OR size for 2 normal volatility"
    ],
    "short_vol_caution": " Do NOT sell options (short vol) within 7 days of earnings"
}
```

**Warning Levels**:
- **HIGH** (0-7 days): Major event imminent
- **MODERATE** (8-14 days): Plan ahead
- **LOW** (15-21 days): Monitor
- **NONE** (&gt;21 days): Clear window

**User Benefit**:
Prevents beginners from getting crushed by earnings volatility.

---

### 4.2 IV Context for Options Cards
**Impact**: Medium (prevents overpaying)
**Files**: All options cards

**Enhanced Options Cards**:
```python
"iv_context": {
    "current_iv": 45,
    "iv_percentile": 85,  # 85th percentile = very expensive
    "interpretation": "VERY EXPENSIVE",
    "vs_sector_avg": "+12 points above tech sector average",
    "vs_spy": "+18 points above SPY",
    "earnings_impact": "IV elevated due to earnings in 5 days",
    "strategy_recommendation": {
        "avoid": ["Buying calls/puts (overpaying for premium)"],
        "consider": ["Defined-risk spreads", "Waiting for IV crush post-earnings"],
        "advanced": ["Selling premium if experienced"]
    },
    "iv_crush_estimate": "Expect 20-30% IV drop after earnings (historical avg)"
}
```

**Beginner Protection**:
```python
if iv_percentile > 80 and days_to_earnings < 7:
    warnings.append(
        " BEGINNER WARNING: IV extremely high before earnings. "
        "Options are very expensive. Most buyers lose money due to IV crush. "
        "If you must trade, use small size and understand you're betting on "
        "move LARGER than expected."
    )
```

**User Benefit**:
Prevents classic beginner mistake of buying expensive options before earnings.

---

## Priority 5: Data Quality & Robustness

### 5.1 Symbol-Aware Fallback Logic
**Impact**: Medium (improves reliability)
**Files**: All ticker cards

**Issue**:
If user requests `trading_date=2025-01-20` but that stock has no data for that date (e.g., wasn't trading), card returns "no data" instead of falling back to latest available.

**Proposed Solution**:
```python
async def fetch_with_fallback(
    self,
    symbol: str,
    requested_date: date,
    max_lookback_days: int = 5
) -> Optional[dict]:
    """
    Try requested date first. If no data, search back up to max_lookback_days.
    """
    for days_back in range(max_lookback_days + 1):
        check_date = requested_date - timedelta(days=days_back)
        data = await self.pool.fetchrow(query, symbol, check_date)
        if data:
            return {
                **dict(data),
                "fallback_used": days_back > 0,
                "fallback_date": check_date if days_back > 0 else None
            }
    return None
```

**Response Addition**:
```python
"meta": {
    "trading_date": "2025-01-20",
    "data_date": "2025-01-17",  # Fell back to Friday
    "fallback_used": true,
    "fallback_reason": "No data for symbol on 2025-01-20 (weekend), used latest"
}
```

**User Benefit**:
Cards return useful data instead of "no data" errors when requesting weekend/holiday dates.

---

### 5.2 Improve JSONB Features Handling
**Impact**: Medium (reduces fragility)
**Files**: Many handlers using `features` JSONB field

**Issue**:
Many handlers extract from JSONB `features` field. If structure changes, handlers break.

**Current Fragile Code**:
```python
features = row['features']  # JSONB field
pcr = features['put_call_ratio']  # Breaks if key missing
```

**Proposed Robust Code**:
```python
def safe_get_feature(features: dict, key: str, default=None):
    """Safely extract from JSONB with fallback."""
    try:
        return features.get(key, default) if features else default
    except (TypeError, AttributeError):
        return default

pcr = safe_get_feature(row.get('features'), 'put_call_ratio', 1.0)
```

**Schema Validation**:
```python
# Add to each handler
EXPECTED_FEATURES_SCHEMA = {
    "put_call_ratio": float,
    "iv30": float,
    "expected_move_1d": float,
    # ...
}

def validate_features(features: dict) -> list[str]:
    """Return list of missing required keys."""
    missing = []
    for key, expected_type in EXPECTED_FEATURES_SCHEMA.items():
        if key not in features:
            missing.append(f"Missing key: {key}")
        elif not isinstance(features[key], expected_type):
            missing.append(f"Wrong type for {key}: expected {expected_type}")
    return missing
```

**User Benefit**:
Handlers degrade gracefully instead of crashing on schema changes.

---

### 5.3 Add Input Validation
**Impact**: Medium (prevents errors)
**Files**: All handlers

**Current State**:
Most handlers check `if not symbol` but don't validate format.

**Proposed Validation**:
```python
def validate_symbol(symbol: str) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """
    Returns (is_valid, error_message).
    Valid symbols: 1-5 uppercase letters, optionally with dots/hyphens
    """
    if not symbol:
        return False, "Symbol required"
    if len(symbol) > 10:
        return False, "Symbol too long (max 10 characters)"
    if not re.match(r'^[A-Z]{1,5}([.-][A-Z]{1,2})?$', symbol.upper()):
        return False, f"Invalid symbol format: {symbol}"
    return True, ""

def validate_date(date_param: date) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """Validate date is not future and not too far past."""
    today = date.today()
    if date_param > today:
        return False, f"Date cannot be in future: {date_param}"
    if date_param < today - timedelta(days=365*5):
        return False, f"Date too far in past (max 5 years): {date_param}"
    return True, ""
```

**User Benefit**:
Clear error messages instead of cryptic database errors.

---

## Priority 6: Performance & Logging

### 6.1 Add Query Caching
**Impact**: Low (performance optimization)
**Files**: Market cards (same data requested frequently)

**Concept**:
Market cards (breadth, summary, regime) return same data for all users on same day. Cache aggressively.

**Implementation**:
```python
from functools import lru_cache
from datetime import date

@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
async def get_market_breadth_cached(trading_date: date):
    """Cache market breadth for 5 minutes."""
    # Actual query here
    pass

# Or use Redis with TTL
async def get_with_redis_cache(key: str, ttl: int, fetch_func):
    cached = await redis.get(key)
    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)
    data = await fetch_func()
    await redis.setex(key, ttl, json.dumps(data))
    return data
```

**User Benefit**:
Faster response times, reduced database load.

---

### 6.2 Mask Database Credentials in Logs
**Impact**: Low (security improvement)
**Files**: `config.py`, startup logging

**Current**:
Logs may expose full connection strings with passwords.

**Proposed**:
```python
def mask_db_url(url: str) -> str:
    """
    postgresql://user:PASSWORD@host:5432/db
    
    postgresql://user:***@host:5432/db
    """
    pattern = r'://([^:]+):([^@]+)@'
    return re.sub(pattern, r'://\1:***@', url)

logger.info(f"Connected to: {mask_db_url(DATABASE_URL)}")
```

**User Benefit**:
Security - no password exposure in logs.

---

## Priority 7: Testing & CI

### 7.1 Add Unit Tests
**Impact**: High (code quality)
**Files**: New `tests/` directory

**Proposed Test Structure**:
```
tests/
 test_handlers/
    test_market_breadth.py
    test_ticker_performance.py
    ...
 test_formatters/
    test_beginner_formatting.py
    ...
 test_utils/
    test_validation.py
    test_calculations.py
 fixtures/
     market_breadth_data.json
     ticker_data.json
```

**Example Test**:
```python
import pytest
from sigmatiq_card_api.handlers.market_breadth import MarketBreadthHandler

@pytest.fixture
def sample_breadth_data():
    return {
        "advancing": 2847,
        "declining": 1234,
        "above_ma50_pct": 68.0,
        "new_highs": 156,
        "new_lows": 23
    }

def test_beginner_formatting(sample_breadth_data):
    handler = MarketBreadthHandler(None)
    result = handler._format_beginner(sample_breadth_data)

    assert result["health"] == "Healthy"
    assert "above_ma50_pct" in result
    assert result["above_ma50_pct"] == 68.0

def test_health_classification():
    handler = MarketBreadthHandler(None)
    assert handler._classify_health(75) == "Healthy"
    assert handler._classify_health(45) == "Mixed"
    assert handler._classify_health(25) == "Weak"
```

**User Benefit**:
Confidence that cards work correctly, regression prevention.

---

### 7.2 Add CI Workflow
**Impact**: Medium (development velocity)
**File**: `.github/workflows/test.yml`

**Proposed Workflow**:
```yaml
name: Test Card API

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -e ".[dev]"

## Priority 8: Outcomes & Calibration (Future)

### 8.1 Track Forward Returns
**Impact**: Low (future optimization)
**Concept**: Long-term improvement via feedback loop

**Proposed Schema**:
```sql
-- Extend cd.cards_usage_log
ALTER TABLE cd.cards_usage_log ADD COLUMN forward_returns JSONB;

-- Structure:
{
  "1d_return": 2.3,   -- +2.3% next day
  "5d_return": 4.1,   -- +4.1% next 5 days
  "stop_hit": false,  -- Was stop hit?
  "target_hit": true, -- Was target hit?
  "max_adverse_excursion": -1.2,  -- Worst drawdown
  "max_favorable_excursion": 5.8   -- Best runup
}
```

**Usage**:
After 1-5 days, backfill forward returns for each card usage. Analyze which signals/thresholds work best.

**Examples**:
- "Breakout quality score &gt;80 had 71% success rate (actual vs 68% expected)"
- "Momentum score 70-80 underperformed - adjust threshold to 75+"
- "Reversal signals in trending markets failed 65% - add trend filter"

**User Benefit** (Future):
Continuously improving thresholds and signals based on real outcomes.
